# Water-Segmentation

Developed a deep learning-based segmentation model using **U-Net++** and **EfficientNet**.  
Trained on a small dataset (**80 images**), achieving an **IoU Score of ~0.5** between predictions and ground truth.  

**Tools:** Android Studio, IMU, GPS, Bluetooth.  

## Setup & Execution  

1. Extract the submitted ZIP file and upload its contents to the cloud.  
2. In `water_segmentation_final.ipynb`, modify the paths in the first and third cells according to the storage location.  
3. Connect to a GPU and run all the cells.  
4. The results will appear in `dataset2/output`.  
5. *(Optional)* Use `water_segmentation_iou.ipynb` to calculate the IoU Score. Make sure to modify the paths before running it.
